##Git Work Flow

Fork & Clone & Add & Commit & Push
* In terminal navigate to 'programs' folder
* Clone with git clone url (copied from Git)
* Create new file for notes
* Add to repo, before adding content
* git add notes/monday.md
* git commit -m "Add notes file for Monday"
* git add -p (stage changes)
* git commit -m "Add changes to notes"
* git push origin master

Add, commit, push (repeat often)

Use good commit messages:
* Separate subject from body with a blank line
* Limit the subject line to 50 characters
* Capitalize the subject line
* Do not end the subject line with a period
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line
* Wrap the body at 72 characters
* Use the body to explain what and why vs. how


##Command Line
cd  Change directory
ls  List files
pwd Present working directory
git clone url (copied from Git)
git add -p (stage changes)
git add --all (stage all untracked files)
git status (shows which updated files are untracked [not Git added] and which are staged)
git commit -m "Add good descriptive commit message"
git push origin master (uploads commit to Git)


##Java Notes

**Data Types**
* strings (always in quotes; "this is a string")
* numbers
* booleans (true, false, <, >)

**Variables**
* We store data in variables. Type variable name to display value. To assign a variable, var fruit = "apple";

**Manipulating Numbers & Strings**
* comparisons (>, <, >=, <=, ===, !== (not equal to))
* modulo
* string length (.length)
* substrings ("hello" .substring (0,3) will result in "hell"
* = is for assignment; === is for equal

Read Evaluate Print Loop (REPL)
Can use double or single quotes. We are going to use single quotes. (I think)
Spaces count!
//"This will comment text"//
